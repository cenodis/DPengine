# DPengine

An alternative, experimental engine for [Desktop Ponies](https://github.com/RoosterDragon/Desktop-Ponies/), written in C and focused on performance.

The [animation base](anim) is a downscaled version of the [original base](https://github.com/RoosterDragon/Desktop-Ponies/tree/master/Content/Ponies), created by artists contributing to DP.

The source code is meant to be built with Code::Blocks. In case you want to use another IDE, refer to .CBP files for library lists and compilation flags.

## Release notes

For now, this project is in a pre-alpha state: it only supports Windows and Linux (but not Mac), it lacks interactions and controls, it contains glitchy animations, itâ€¦ meh. I hope it all gets better soon ^_^
